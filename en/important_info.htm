                <h2>Important Information</h2>
                <p>TLN is a series of smart contracts which provide economic incentives designed to stimulate liquidity
                    provision within the VOW ecosystem. These contracts were not deployed by a corporate vehicle (or
                    director of such a vehicle) associated with the VOW token. TLN is a holistic defi system which
                    operates autonomously and will exist for as long as the Ethereum and BSC blockchains exist. You are
                    not required to pay any money to the TLN contracts, any person or company, to use the TLN smart
                    contracts. </p>
                <p>‍</p>
                <p>You do not get paid by the TLN smart contract for adding liquidity to UniSwap, or from referring
                    others to use the TLN contracts. The TLN contracts simply track blockchain activity and
                    programatically mint, allocate and burn a supply of TLN tokens. Your interactions with the TLN
                    contracts are all instigated by your own private keys. </p>
                <p>‍</p>
                <p>There is no &quot;operator&quot; (person or company) which can alter the TLN smart contracts . This
                    means you are wholly responsible for every signature you sign and no one else can be. Do not be
                    misled that any kind of guarantees are asserted, or implied, by the existence of the TLN system. TLN
                    is not a &quot;safe place to put your money&quot;. It is a self running program which you can
                    interact with, according to pre-programmed rules, to achieve the results you desire.</p>
                <p>‍</p>
                <blockquote>TLN is a smart contract, not a company.</blockquote>
                <h3>Overview of the TLN smart contract</h3>
                <p>Once you have bought VOW and <sup>v</sup>$ from a centralized, or decentralized, exchange you are now
                    exposed to the market dependent value of the VOW and <sup>v</sup>$ you hold.</p>
                <p>‍<br />You are not required to buy tokens from a specific person, or company, at any time. Who you
                    buy from is entirely up to you. Like any other assets, VOW and <sup>v</sup>$ go down and up in value
                    compared to other assets like the USD continuously. One of the differences between VOW and USD is
                    that there is a limited supply of VOW and there is an unlimited supply of USD. This is exactly the
                    same difference between Bitcoin and USD, and it is one of the reasons why the crypto community
                    prefer to hold some of their wealth in crypto long term.</p>
                <p>‍</p>
                <p>Over time, there could be major economic advantages of holding crypto as opposed to USD, but there
                    could also be huge disadvantages. You could also lose all value at any time for a multitude of
                    reasons. It is therefore important to weigh up these risks and opportunities before buying any
                    crypto asset. There are a great many risks in engaging with cryptocurrency and De-Fi protocols. </p>
                <p>‍</p>
                <p>Some of these are known risks such as cryptocurrency can rise or fall in value, and other risks are
                    unknown, such as the collapse of the internet or Ethereum itself or changes in the regulatory
                    landscape. You should be cautious and never invest more than you can afford to lose in any project.
                    TLN is an entirely decentralised ecosystem, which means that in addition to all the above mentioned
                    risks, no one can help you if you lose or misplace your private keys.</p>
                <p>‍<br />UniSwap is the world&#x27;s largest decentralized exchange, where users can swap tokens with
                    each other in a completely decentralised manner. It also allows anyone to participate as a liquidity
                    provider to the overall crypto market, by depositing pairs of tokens into what are called liquidity
                    pools. Once you have bought VOW and <sup>v</sup>$ you can choose to deposit them (as liquidity) in
                    the VOW / <sup>v</sup>$ UniSwap pool. UniSwap will then automatically mint LP tokens and send them
                    back to you, as proof that you have deposited liquidity. </p>
                <p>‍</p>
                <p>You can also purchase LP tokens directly from anyone else who holds LP tokens instead of buying
                    VOW and <sup>v</sup>$ and then adding them to UniSwap directly. Because LP tokens may trade for
                    more, or less, than the VOW and <sup>v</sup>$ they each represent, you could gain, or lose, by
                    purchasing LP tokens instead of VOW and <sup>v</sup>$. Once again, the best thing about defi is that
                    only you can sign every transaction, so no one else makes a decision for you.<br /><br />As soon as
                    you&#x27;ve deposited liquidity (or are holding your LP tokens) you will receive an ongoing share of
                    the VOW / <sup>v</sup>$ pool&#x27;s 0.3% trading fees. These fees are accumulated as people and bots
                    trade through the pool of liquidity that you have contributed to. It is anticipated, but by no means
                    gauranteed, that these fees will grow, if the VOW ecosystem grows and more trading is necessitated.
                    <br /><br />Accumulated fees are calculated by UniSwap&#x27;s contract and paid out when you send
                    back your LP tokens to UniSwap. You can do this at any time.<br />When you send your LP tokens back
                    to UniSwap you will receive your assets back, as well as any proportional fees due. Because of
                    something called impermanent loss you may receive different amounts of tokens than you originally
                    deposited in UniSwap, and the value of these tokens, relative to fiat currencies, may be different
                    to the value you purchased the tokens at originally.  <br />Once you have LP tokens, instead of them
                    just sitting in your wallet, you can choose to stake them in the TLN smart contract for 367 days.
                    During this time you will not be able to access your LP tokens and return them to UniSwap, but your
                    tokens do not &quot;go anywhere&quot;. They just sit in the contract, unused, and 367 days later you
                    can withdraw them. You can then send them back to UniSwap, or re-stake. Again whatever you choose is
                    100% up to you. <br /><br />As long as you have your LP tokens staked in the TLN contract, you will
                    start to accumulate &quot;borrowing capacity&quot; in the form of TLN tokens. TLN are automatically
                    produced by the TLN smart contract. Additionally, you can increase your borrowing capacity when
                    others that you have introduced to TLN choose to become Liquidity Providers and stake their UniSwap
                    LP tokens.  Fees and rates of TLN minting and distribution vary by referral as well as your degree
                    of influence over that referral. </p>
                <p>‍<br />For example, you will receive more TLN if the referral is tracked directly to you, and less,
                    if that referral is three levels of influence away from you.  It is illegal for a promoter or a
                    participant in a trading scheme to persuade anyone to make a payment by promising benefits from
                    getting others to join a scheme. Do not be miss-led that high earnings are easily achieved. It is
                    important to note that TLN provides borrowing capacity not earnings, so there is no direct value to
                    a TLN token.</p>
                <p>In order to use your TLN borrowing capacity you must choose how many <sup>v</sup>$ you need (for
                    example <sup>v</sup>$1000) and then you must burn (in this example) 1000 TLN, as well as post $200
                    USD worth of VOW as collateral. The borrowing contract will release you <sup>v</sup>$1000. You can
                     spend, send or swap it as you desire. </p>
                <p>‍<br />At some point in the future you can send back v$1000 to the contract and redeem your
                    VOW collateral. It is worth doing this if the price of VOW rises, or the price of v$ falls. You
                    currently have 36 months to do this or anyone else can redeem your VOW by repaying your
                    <sup>v</sup>$ loan for you.<br /><br /><sup>v</sup>$ and VOW are acknowledged to be registered
